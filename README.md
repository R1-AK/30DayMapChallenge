# 30DayMapChallenge
Welcome to my 30-Day Map Challenge repository! üó∫Ô∏è In this project, I embark on a journey to explore the beauty of geospatial data using Python and R. As a person with geospatial science background but newcomer using programming languange, I aim to learn and grow with each map I create over the course of 30 days.
