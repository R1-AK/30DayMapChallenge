**Mapping the Capital Cities of Indonesian Provinces**

- Type of data:

  polygon and point

- Data source:

  The shapefile and CSV file of Indonesian provinces used in this project were downloaded from the Indonesia Geospatial Agency (BIG). Please note that this dataset represents   the old version of Indonesian provinces, as based on the previous regulation. Indonesia currently has 38 provinces based on the latest regulation in 2022, but for the
  purposes of this challenge, I'll be working with the older dataset containing fewer provinces. You can download the dataset here:
