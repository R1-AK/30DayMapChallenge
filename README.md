# 30DayMapChallenge
Welcome to my 30-Day Map Challenge repository! üó∫Ô∏è In this project, I embark on a journey to explore the beauty of geospatial data using Python and R. As a person with geospatial science background but newcomer using programming languange, I aim to learn and grow with each map I create over the course of 30 days.

**Day 1 - Mapping the Capital Cities of Indonesian Provinces**
Type of data: polygon and point
Data source:
The shapefile and CSV file of Indonesian provinces used in this project were downloaded from the Indonesia Geospatial Agency (BIG). Please note that this dataset represents the old version of Indonesian provinces, as based on the previous regulation. Indonesia currently has 38 provinces based on the latest regulation in 2022, but for the purposes of this challenge, I'll be working with the older dataset containing fewer provinces.
